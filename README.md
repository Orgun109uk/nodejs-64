# Development Environments - Ubuntu 64 - Node.js

A Ubuntu Server 64bit development environment preloaded with Node.js and additional useful development tools.

The environment is built using [Packer] and provisioned by [Vagrant].

### Requirements

In order to build and run this development environment there are a few requirements needed:

  - [Packer]
  - [Vagrant] - 1.7.1+
  - [VirtualBox] - 4.3.26
  - [Cygwin] - (recommended) With at least SSH, and perhaps GIT

### Preloaded

The VM build provides the following tools preloaded:

  - [GIT]
  - [Cloud9 IDE] - A fully loaded web based IDE with full debugging features
  - [NVM] - Node version managment tool
  - [Node.js] - 0.12
  - [Grunt CLI]
  - [MongoDB]
  - [Mongo Express]
  - [MailDev]

### Build

To build the initial vagrant box, [Packer] will need to be downloaded and extracted into the a new directory called *packer* and should look like (assuming you cloned this GIT branch into C:\vm\dev64-nodejs) C:\vm\dev64-nodejs\packer.

Once extracted open a new [Cygwin] terminal and navigate to the root directory of the repository and run:

```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

This can take upto an hour or so, and once completed a *.box file should be created in the data directory.

### Running

To run the development environment again use [Cygwin] and point it to the repository root and execute:

```sh
$ vagrant up
```

Once this has finished building and launching the environment use the following command to access the environment via SSH:

```sh
$ vagrant ssh
```

For more information on using [Packer] and [Vagrant] please visit the respective sites, they provide very details documents and there is plenty of information around on the web ;)

### Access and tools details

The default user account for the VM is *vagrant* and the password is also *vagrant*, and the following are the default properties setup in the Vagrantfile (these can be changed if required by editing the Vagrantfile):

  - 1 CPU
  - 1024 MB RAM
  - Private network IP - 192.168.200.100
  - Shared folder is *workspace* which points to ~/workspace within the guest VM.

Access to the web tools can be accessed via:
  - Cloud9 IDE: http://192.168.200.100:8181
  - Mongo Express (DB): http://192.168.200.100:8081
  - MailDev (Mail SMTP): http://192.168.200.100:1080
